# server-down-notifier
This program is made to send a text if a server goes down with some other options.
I use PyCharm for python development, and for password collection to work you need to emulate terminal in console in the interpreter options.
In any regular terminal it will work fine.
You will need to allow unsecure apps to login to your gmail account so that the emails can be sent.
